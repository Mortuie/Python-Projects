# Small Python Projects

## Introduction
These are small individual projects/games coded and produced by me in python. This is for me
to try and start building a small portfolio of python programming and also just to get some 
GUI and python programming practice. Inspiration has been taken from various sources and if 
so is quoted in the comments in the respective projects.
